* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

## Installation
These are a more detailed area of steps if the Get Started notes were not detailed enough.

1. First open a terminal or command prompt in a folder you wish the project to be pulled down to from github.
2. Then run the following command:

```
git clone git clone https://github.com/csteamproject/aptiv_api.git
```

This should clone down the project if you have full access to it, if you do not then you have to ask the owner if you can have access to collaborate.

3. After the project finishes cloning down inside your terminal or command prompt you can `cd aptivWebclient` so that you are within the cloned project. There you can run this command:


```
bundle install
```

This should get all the packages not mentioned in the prerequisites and update any old packages that have fallen behind in age.
